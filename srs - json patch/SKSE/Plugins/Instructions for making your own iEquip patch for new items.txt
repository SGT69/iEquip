Notes for making your own patch


Make a copy of iEquip_Template.json.txt and rename it to give it a unique name, removing the .txt extension (iEquip_WhateverYouLike.json).  

Add new items to the relevant sections (detailed below).  Each item must follow the correct format - name, pluginName, formID, isLightMod.  Refer to iEquip_Core.json to see how it is structured.

At present only pluginName and formID are read, the name and light mod flag are currently just for reference.

The plugin name must be exact, and the formID should not include the mod index (ie if xEdit shows the formID as 0x2A008611 then enter 0x008611).

Each item should be contained within {} with a comma after each.  The final entry in each section should NOT have a comma following it.  For example:



"spears": [
	{
		"name": "Riekling Spear",
		"pluginName": "Dragonborn.esm",
		"formID": "0x017720",
		"isLightMod": false
	},
	{
		"name": "Riekling Spear",
		"pluginName": "Dragonborn.esm",
		"formID": "0x01B935",
		"isLightMod": false
	}
],


Completely remove any empty subsections you are not adding items to.  Failing to do so will break the entries for that subsection from all patch files including iEquip_Core.json.


Sub Sections:

The fire, ice, shock and poison sections are used for identifying mod-added magic arrows so they show the correct effect icon alongside the ammo icon.

The spellwards section is used for identifying mod-added ward spells and any other spell you wish to have selected by QuickShield (ie Bound Shield).

The other sections are all for identifying mod-added items to receive the specific icons rather than those for the base item type the records are built on.



Feel free to share it or send it to us and we'll upload it to the main page.,

Happy patching!
